3. The main goal is to change life. Lack of interest in current work as a result of lack of development on it, hobbies, and life in general are the main reasons that led to the decision: "It's time to change my life." Many of my friends changed jobs and became developers, designers, business analysts, QA and their life became interesting, full of vivid emotions. Сontinuous development of skills, new acquaintances with amazing people, and the work process itself - these are the main things for which it is worth changing everything.
